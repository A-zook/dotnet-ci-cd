# Quick Start - Proceed Without Password

## Current Status
- ✅ Infrastructure deployed: `54.242.141.137`
- ✅ .NET app built and ready
- ⏳ Windows password still initializing

## Proceed with GitHub Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to github.com and create new repo, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-ci-cd.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets (use placeholders for now)
- `EC2_PUBLIC_IP`: `54.242.141.137`
- `WINDOWS_PASSWORD`: `TEMP_PASSWORD` (update later)

### 3. Test CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
echo "Test change" >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Test CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Pipeline
- Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/actions`
- Watch the workflow run (it will fail at Ansible step due to password)
- This confirms the pipeline structure works

### 5. Get Password Later
Run every few minutes until ready:
```bash
python get-windows-password.py
```

### 6. Update Secrets
Once you have the real password:
- Update GitHub secret `WINDOWS_PASSWORD`
- Re-run the failed workflow

## Alternative: Manual Password Reset
If password takes too long, you can:
1. RDP to the instance using AWS Console "Connect"
2. Set a new password manually
3. Use that password in GitHub secrets

The CI/CD pipeline is ready - you just need the password to complete deployment!
